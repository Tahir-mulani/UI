# UI — Learning Workspace

Welcome to the UI learning repository. This workspace contains HTML, CSS, and JS examples and exercises used to explore core UI concepts: layout, forms, lists, tables, image maps, and responsive styling.

## Quick start
- Open [UI/index.html](UI/index.html) in your browser to browse sample pages.
- Use the VS Code Live Server extension or open files directly to preview.
- Read notes and assignment samples in the "UI Assignment" folder for dated practice exercises.

## What you'll find
- Hands-on HTML pages demonstrating lists, tables, images, and forms.
- CSS examples showing layout patterns and pseudo-elements.
- Small experiments and assignments grouped by date for progressive learning.

## Learning goals
- Understand semantic HTML: lists (UL/OL), tables, forms.
- Practice layout with CSS (flexbox, basic positioning).
- Create interactive UIs with image maps and accessible forms.
- Build and iterate on small UI assignments to reinforce concepts.

## Recommended walkthrough
1. Start with [UI/index.html](UI/index.html) to see the navigation.
2. Explore structure examples: [UI/UL.html](UI/UL.html) and [UI/OL.html](UI/OL.html).
3. See table usage: [UI/table.html](UI/table.html) and [UI/table_demo2.html](UI/table_demo2.html).
4. Try form examples: [UI/emp.html](UI/emp.html) and assignments in [UI Assignment/1-10-2025/reg_form.html](UI%20Assignment/1-10-2025/reg_form.html).
5. Inspect CSS patterns in [CSS_examples/layout1.html](CSS_examples/layout1.html) and [CSS_examples/css/style.css](CSS_examples/css/style.css).

## Folder highlights
- UI/ — core example pages and notes
- UI/css/ — styles used by UI pages (emp.css, registration.css, use_research.css)
- CSS_examples/ — focused CSS experiments and layouts
- UI Assignment/ — dated assignments and exercise solutions
- User/ — user-specific examples

## Tips
- Use browser dev tools to inspect DOM and CSS rules.
- Copy pages into a sandbox file to test modifications safely.
- Keep notes in [UI/notes.txt](UI/notes.txt) as you learn.

## Contributing / Notes
- Add new examples or improved styles into the corresponding folders.
- Keep files small and focused so each demonstrates one concept.
- Use [UI/notes.txt](UI/notes.txt) for to-do items and learning points.

Happy learning — build, tinker, and iterate!
